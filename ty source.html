<p>My greatest achievement is being able to write records that are real snapshots of what is going on in my life. i won't repeat myself for the sake of commerce, or to please other people but able to continue with my normal life. I love what i do, but more so, i am glad to have people who care about me close by.</p>

<p>Also, i think self discovery is also part of my achievement in life, because once you discover yourself and accept what you are, then you can fulfil your potential and be happy.

The greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to one's opportunities and make the most of one's resources. I would say my greatest achievement in life right now, my greatest achievement period is, and i'm still trying to achieve it, is to be a wonderful father to my kids.</p>
